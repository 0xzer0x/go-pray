## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

`go-pray` reads from a `config.yml` file to manage settings. You can specify a custom configuration file using the `--config` flag. By default, the application searches for `config.yml` in the following paths:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/go-pray`
2. `$HOME/.config/go-pray`
3. `$HOME/.go-pray`

An example [config.yml](./config.example.yml) is available. You can modify it to suit your location and preferences.
